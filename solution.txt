/**
FUNCTION getConsecutiveSubstrings(string):

    CREATE empty array result 

    FOR i from 0 to length of string -1: 

        FOR j from i to length of string -1: 

            ADD substring from index i to j (inclusive) to result

And a written explanation of your solution

/**
*Algorithmic Type: 
* Brute-force substring generation using nested loops
*/

/**
*Time Complexity Analysis: 
* The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. 
* This is due to the use of two nested loops that generate all possible consecutive substrings.
* The space complexity is also 0(n^2) because the algorithm stores every generated substring in an output array.
